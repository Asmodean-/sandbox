# Experiments!

## Recent
* Arkano22 SSAO implementation
* Several other GLSL 330-core post-processing effects: film grain, FXAA
* CEGUI layout system
* Procedural sky dome with Preetham and Hosek-Wilkie models (and borked HDR)
* Arcball camera
* Basic image morphologies (erode/dilate)
* Opinionated 3d gizmo editing tool
* Island terrain with a simple water shader (waves, reflections)

## In Progress

* Better water shading (refraction, skybox lighting)
* GLSL Shader hot-reload
* UI layout via cassowary constraint solver (Rhea library)
* Dual contouring + terrain deformation (ref. impl)
* A simple scenegraph
* CPU path tracer (+ lighting baker?)
* Immediate Mode GUI test

* Fluid simulator with a compute shader
* Procedural clouds
* Deferred rendering experiments
* L-System + particles
* Impulse response raytracer
* Optitrak nat-net i/o
* Bruneton Sky Model
* BRDF / PBR Shaders
* Automatic UV generation (foo library)
