# Experiments!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ddiakopoulos/sandbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ddiakopoulos/sandbox)

United under the arbitrarily chosen namespace "avl" (short for Anvil).

## Recent
* CEGUI layout system
* Procedural sky dome with Preetham and Hosek-Wilkie models
* Arcball camera
* Arkano22 SSAO implementation
* Several GLSL 330 post-processing effects: film grain, FXAA
* Opinionated 3d gizmo editing tool
* Island terrain with a simple water shader (waves, reflections)
* Frame capture => GIF export
* 3D Euclidean patterns
* GLSL Shader hot-reload (efsw library)
* Spherical environment mapping (matcap shading)
* Library of procedural meshes (cube, sphere, cone, torus, etc)
* Billboarded triangle mesh line renderer
* Reaction-diffusion CPU simulation (Gray-Scott)
* Incubation of computer vision functions on top of [librealsense](https://www.github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) (minivision)
* Decal projection on arbitrary meshes

## In Progress
* HDR pipeline (Bloom, etc)

* Bruneton Sky Model
* UI layout via cassowary constraint solver (Rhea library)
* Procedural clouds
* Impulse response raytracer
* Graph/Node editor (LabSound bindings)
* Lua (Angelscript, etc)
