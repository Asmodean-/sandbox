# Experiments!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ddiakopoulos/sandbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ddiakopoulos/sandbox)

United under the arbitrarily chosen namespace "avl" (short for Anvil).

## Recent
* Lightweight, header-only opengl wrapper (GL_API.hpp)
* 2D resolution-independent layout system for screen debug output (textures, etc)
* Procedural sky dome with Preetham and Hosek-Wilkie models
* Arcball camera
* Opinionated gizmo editing tool for 3D scenes
* Island terrain with a simple water shader (waves, reflections)
* Frame capture => GIF export
* 3D Euclidean patterns
* GLSL shader program hot-reload (via efsw library)
* Spherical environment mapping (matcap shading)
* Library of procedural meshes (cube, sphere, cone, torus, capsule, etc)
* Billboarded triangle mesh line renderer
* Reaction-diffusion CPU simulation (Gray-Scott)
* Incubation of computer vision functions on top of [librealsense](https://www.github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) (minivision)
* Decal projection on arbitrary meshes
* HDR + Bloom + Tonemapping Pipeline
* Arkano22 SSAO implementation
* Several GLSL 330 post-processing effects: film grain, FXAA
* Orconut-Dear-ImGui Bindings
* Simple PCF shadow mapping with a variety of lights (directional, spot, point)
* Instanced rendering support

## In Progress
* Transform-feedback particles
* Physically-based text rendering

* L-System + particles
* Spherical harmonic lighting experiment
* Dual contouring + terrain deformation (ref. impl)
* Animation curve editor (Tinyspline)
* Better water shading (refraction, normals, sun position, skybox reflections)
* Bruneton Sky Model
* UI layout via cassowary constraint solver (Rhea library)
* Procedural clouds
* Impulse response raytracer
* Graph/Node editor (LabSound bindings)
* Lua (Angelscript, etc)
* Pathfinding algos (Recast navigation)
* Isosurface computation
* Reaction-diffusion over time (3d)
* Optitrak nat-net i/o
* Automatic UV generation (Foo library)
